## About the project

This project is aimed to be part of a groups of open tools for **Interferencias** members and curious internet users. This will be useful for getting a big picture of internet censorship around the world in one sight, and it's supposed to resemble [reporters sans frontiers' enemies of the internet study](http://12mars.rsf.org/2014-en/). 

The app is supposed to have:

* An interactive map with information
* Reliable sources
* Comments allowed in each case


## Why Concerning about Internet Censorship?

Internet censorship is one of the main problems of our era, which many users around the globe suffer everyday. Some proffesionals such as journalists, activists and similar are used to see their digital rihts beaten, but our daily life also hides these problems. Digital privacy and awareness is as important as defending freedom of expression, and for so many NGOs are fighting, for the users (such as the [EFF](eff.org) and others). These little projects could mean a difference for eveyone being able to easily check the reality of the internet.
